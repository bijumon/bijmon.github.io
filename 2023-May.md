> Great game development is actively harmed by this assumption.  Pre-allocating resources at an early stage interrupts the exploratory iteration needed to find the fun in a game. A written plan that stretches months into the future is like a stake through the heart of a good game process. Instead of quickly pivoting to amplify a delightful opportunity found during play testing, you end up blindly barreling towards completion on a some ineffectual paper fantasy.

[Development notes from xkcd's Gravity and Escape Speed](https://chromakode.com/post/xkcd-gravity-escape-speed/) #gamedev

> Escape Seed is a large space exploration game created and drawn by Randall Munroe. 
> 
> This was one of the most ambitious — and most delayed — April Fools comics we’ve ever shipped. The art, physics, story, game logic, and render performance all needed to work together to pull this off. We decided to take the time to get it right.

> The game is a spiritual successor to last year’s [Gravity](https://xkcd.com/2712) space exploration comic. Our goal was to deepen the game with a bigger map and more orbital mechanics challenges to play with.
